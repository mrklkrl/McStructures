# McStructures
On the surface, this is a project that implements some basic data structures.

The real purpose of it, however, is to experiment with different ways of managing a project.

This includes testing, deployment, development environment and documentation.

Development is being done in vscode, so a .vscode directory is included with all that is needed to test within vscode. A makefile is used to compile.

For testing, see the directory "tests". This includes tests in pure C for each associated source file in src. tests.c is the main test application. It can be compiled with the makefile using the command "make" from the root directory of the project. Then you can run with the command "make run"

Documentation is done with doxygen. each header file contains doxygen style comments. The documentation can then be generated by running the command "make docs"
